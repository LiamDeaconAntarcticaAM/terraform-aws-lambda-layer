  Terraform module designed to facilitate the creation of AWS Lambda layers.

# How to use this project
usage: |-
  ### Simple Example

  ```hcl
  module "layer" {
    source = "git::https://github.com/enter-at/terraform-aws-lambda-layer.git?ref=main"
    layer_name   = "dependencies"
    package_file = "../Pipfile"
  }
  ```

  ### Advanced Example

  ```hcl
  module "layer" {
    source = "git::https://github.com/enter-at/terraform-aws-lambda-layer.git?ref=main"
    layer_name   = "dependencies"
    source_dir   = "../src/lib"
    source_type  = "python"

    rsync_pattern = [
      "--exclude='**tests**'",
      "--exclude='**__pycache__**'",
      "--include=module/{a,b,c}/",
      "--include='*.py'",
      "--exclude='module/*'"
    ]
  }
  ```

  ### Example on Ruby Gem layer

  ```hcl
  module "layer" {
    source = "git::https://github.com/enter-at/terraform-aws-lambda-layer.git?ref=main"
    layer_name   = "dependencies"
    source       = "."
    package_file = "Gemfile"
    compatible_runtimes = ["ruby2.7"]
  }
  ```

  Note the following

  * The package includes the following directory structure ruby/*ruby\_version*/...
  * The ruby directory contains Gemfile/Gemfile.lock. These are included for referential integrity
    You will may want to symlink these together with your `lambda_function`

  ```sh
  # In your script for packing lambda function
  ln -sf /opt/ruby/Gemfile Gemfile
  ln -sf /opt/ruby/Gemfile.lock Gemfile.lock
  ```

include:
  - "docs/terraform.md"
